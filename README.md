# Airena RTMP Server

A custom RTMP server built with NestJS, NodeMediaServer (NMS), and SQLite. This server supports RTMP streaming, HLS playback, dynamic stream key generation, and now features a fully functional API for stream management.

## Features

- **RTMP Server**: Push streams to the server via RTMP from OBS or other RTMP clients.
- **Stream Key Generation**: Dynamically generate stream keys and stream IDs for secure streaming.
- **HLS Playback**: Serve HLS streams to frontend players.
- **Frontend Integration**: Easy integration for frontend with stream keys.
- **Live Stream Metrics**: Real-time metrics (bitrate, processing latency, estimated bandwidth) for live streams, calculated via FFmpeg and broadcast over WebSockets.
- **VOD Recording**: Automatic recording of live streams to MP4 files.
- **REST API**: Comprehensive API for managing stream keys, retrieving stream/VOD information, and updating settings.
- **WebSocket API**: For broadcasting live stream metrics.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (>= v16)
2. **NestJS** for backend API
3. **NodeMediaServer** for RTMP/HLS support
4. **SQLite** for the database (local storage)
5. **OBS (or any RTMP-compatible software)** to stream to the server.
6. **FFmpeg**: Required for generating HLS, recording VODs, and calculating live metrics. Ensure FFmpeg is installed on the server where this application runs and is accessible via the system's PATH, or specify its location using the `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadtik/airena-rtmps.git
cd airena-rtmps
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### 4. Configure OBS

- In OBS, go to **Settings > Stream**.
- Set the **Stream Type** to `Custom`.
- Enter the following details:
  - **URL**: `rtmp://localhost:1935/live`
  - **Stream Key**: Obtain a stream key via the API or use a test key.

### 5. Start Streaming

- Start streaming from OBS.
- Access the HLS stream at `http://localhost:8000/media/index.m3u8` in your browser.

### 6. Using the API

- The REST API is up and running.
- Use the API to generate stream keys, manage streams, and retrieve stream information.
- Refer to the API documentation or `/api` endpoint for available routes and usage.

## Upcoming Features

- **Live Metrics**: Real-time analytics for live streams, including:
  - Viewer count
  - Bitrate monitoring
  - Stream health indicators

Stay tuned for updates!

## Configuration: Environment Variables

This application is configured using environment variables. For local development, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store these variables. In production, these should be set in your deployment environment.

| Variable         | Description                                                                 | Example Value                     | Default Value        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| `PORT`           | The port the main application will listen on.                               | `3000`                            | `3000`               |
| `FFMPEG_PATH`    | Path to the FFmpeg executable.                                              | `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` or `C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe` | `ffmpeg`             |
| `RTMP_BASE_URL`  | Base URL for the RTMP server where streams are pushed.                      | `rtmp://yourdomain.com:1935`      | `rtmp://localhost:1935` |
| `HLS_BASE_URL`   | Base URL for the HLS server from where streams are played.                  | `http://yourdomain.com:8000`      | `http://localhost:8000` |
| `MEDIA_ROOT`     | Root directory for storing media files (HLS segments, VODs).                | `./media_files`                   | `./media`            |
| `VOD_DIRECTORY_NAME` | Name of the subdirectory within `MEDIA_ROOT` to store VOD files.        | `recordings`                      | `vod`                |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Your Clerk secret key for authentication.                                   | `sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`    |                      |
| `DATABASE_URL`   | Path to the SQLite database file.                                           | `./data/streaming.db`            | `./data/streaming.db` |

**Note:** For `FFMPEG_PATH`, if FFmpeg is in your system's PATH, you can often leave it as the default `ffmpeg`. Otherwise, provide the full path to the executable.

## WebSocket API

The server provides real-time updates for stream metrics via WebSockets.

### Connecting

Connect to the WebSocket server at the application's base URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:3000` or `wss://yourdomain.com`). The WebSocket gateway is typically available on the same port as the HTTP server.

### Receiving Metrics Updates

Listen for the `metricsUpdate` event. This event is emitted globally whenever metrics for any active stream are updated.

**Event:** `metricsUpdate`

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "streamKey": "your_stream_key",
  "bitrate": 5000,       // Current bitrate in Kbps
  "bandwidth": 6000,     // Estimated required bandwidth in Kbps
  "latency": 120,        // FFmpeg processing latency in ms (lower is better)
  "lastUpdated": 1678886400000 // Timestamp of the last update (milliseconds since epoch)
}
```
- `streamKey` (string): The unique key of the stream these metrics belong to.
- `bitrate` (number): The current video bitrate in Kilobits per second (Kbps).
- `bandwidth` (number): An estimated network bandwidth in Kbps required to sustain the current bitrate (typically bitrate * 1.2).
- `latency` (number): The processing latency reported by the FFmpeg stats process in milliseconds. This is an indicator of the FFmpeg process's health on the server, not end-to-end stream latency.
- `lastUpdated` (number): A Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) indicating when these metrics were last updated on the server.

## REST API Endpoints

The API provides endpoints for managing streams, VODs, and retrieving stream information. All API routes are prefixed with `/api`.

### Authentication

Endpoints marked with **ðŸ”’ Authenticated** require a valid JWT token from Clerk in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Other endpoints are public.

- **Request Body:** None
- **Success Response (200 OK with `video/mp4` content type):**
  The raw video file.
- **Error Responses:**
    - `400 Bad Request`: If the filename is invalid or a path traversal attempt is detected.
    - `404 Not Found`: If the VOD filename does not exist or is not a regular file.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: If there's an issue during file download (e.g., reading the file after headers sent).

#### 3. Get VOD Details (Information)
- **Method & Path:** `GET /api/vod/details/:filename`
